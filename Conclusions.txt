This homework was interesting and a little bit challenging. First task was almost the same as one of the tasks that were done in class and required just simple common sense and logic. The second one was more interesting and required more complicated work but still was easy to done. What it more important for me this assignment didnâ€™t asked us to do a lot of uninteresting simple work as trying out the results of different commands with their interpretation which is great.
